To be able to connect to Google Cloud, you have 
to set the environment variable "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS" 
to value representing the path to file containing the key.

The key is downloaded from the Google Cloud or I can send it to you.

In the IntelliJ IDEA you can configure the Run Configuration 
and add the environment variable there.

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/location/to/key.json
